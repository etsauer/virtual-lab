#Setup Instructions#

Things to note:
- uses simple NAT networking for compatibility with wifi interfaces
- recommend using qcow2 images for quick creation and cloning


###Install KVM and Prerequisites###
Install virtualization packages with the following:

```bash
$ yum install @virtualization python-lxml
```
Also, install the python netaddr module 7.11+. 
- Download the zip file: http://github.com/drkjam/netaddr/
- extract somewhere temporary
- cd into the root directory (netaddr-x.x.x/)
- run 'sudo python setup.py install'
- See https://netaddr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html if you have trouble.

> NOTE: There is a netaddr package in yum (python-netaddr), but at the time of this README doc it contains a version with a bug that prevents our scripts from running. This bug was fixed in version 7.11 so just make sure you are running at least that version.

###Create Base Image###
Use the virt-manager to create a base install from an ISO, using all default options except:
- 8 gb disk, use virtio type
- Hypervisor/Virt Type: kvm
- check box to customize before launch
- NIC -> Device Model: virtio

Once installed and booted, log in as root and do the following:
- Register with subscription-manager. (Verify with a 'yum repolist')
- Create generic user with sudo access, i.e.:

```bash
$ useradd -d /home/vm-user vm-user
$ sed '/^root.*/a vm-user ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL' /etc/sudoers
```
Push Public Key to that User

###Clone Repo###
```bash
$ git clone [git-url]
```

###(Optional) Configure Environment###
The file './config/env.conf' contains default values regarding your kvm environment. Adjust these values according to your needs

###(Optional) Place additional files###
Any files placed in './tmp/files.[name of vm]/' will be placed in '/tmp' on you new vm.

###Run Script###
```bash
### DO Not Run As root ###
$ ./clone mynewvm
```
